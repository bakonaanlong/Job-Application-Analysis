PROJECT TITLE

Job Application Analysis

OVERVIEW

This repository contains analysis i made based on the jobs i have applied for over the last three months. I carried out this analysis to study for new trends in the requirements of jobs so that i can equip myself with the necessary information, therefore giving me leverage.

FEATURES

- Visualizations: Bar charts, pie charts maps, and KPI's.
- Clear and simple layout for easy understanding.


KEY INSIGHTS
- Jobs in Dubai(United Arab Emirates) have the highest average compensation, at around $6,000 per month, followed by Poland, USA and Spain
- Jobs that required knowledge of Cloud services(AWS, Azure, GCP) compensated higher on average
- Jobs that required a degree also paid higher on average
- Excel is the most required tool(No Doubt)
- Nearly 80% of jobs require knowledge of Cloud Services
- 60% of jobs required knowledge of snowflake which is big, considering snowflake is not a household name in data analysis yet


TECHNOLOGIES USED

- SQL for cleaning the data(Removing duplicates, handling null values, creating case statements to create new fields)
- Power Query for Transforming the data
- Power BI for Visualization

DATA SOURCE

-My Linked job application history
